## Brain Mapping

Brain mapping is a set of neuroscience techniques predicated on the mapping of (biological) quantities or properties onto 
spatial representations of the (human or non-human) brain resulting in maps.The brain has a geography that matters.
The cerebral cortex (the grey outer layer of the brain) is folded into our skulls in such a way as to reduce the wiring length of our neurons and improve cognitive function.
Needless to say, this folding is incredibly complex. In order to examine and make sense of this structure, neuroscientists are increasingly turning to maps to represent its complexity. Much like the towns, cities, countries and continents represented on a typical geographic map, areas of the brain are similarly being spatially defined, labelled and understood through a process of mapping.
Mapping the brain is key to understanding how it works. The population is ageing and one in three seniors will die with Alzheimerâ€™s or another dementia. 
Mapping brain areas could help in the early identification of such generative disorders
